hash file

.. note::

   An alternative to using a hash to validate a package's cache is to use an
   :ref:`ASCII-armor <ascii_armor>` instead. Although users can benefit from
   using both validation methods, if desired.

When downloading assets from a remote instance, a package's hash file can be
used to help verify the integrity of any fetched content. For example, if a
package lists a site with a ``my-archive.tgz`` to download, the fetch process
will download the archive and verify its hash to a listed entry before
continuing. If a hash does not match, the build process stops indicating an
unexpected asset was downloaded.

It is recommended that:

- Any URL-based site asset have a hash entry defined for the asset (to ensure
  the package sources are not corrupted or have been unexpectedly replaced).
- A hash entry should exist for license files (additional sanity check if a
  package's license has change).

To create a hash file for a package, add a ``<my-package>.hash`` file inside the
package's directory. The hash file should be a UTF-8 encoded file and can
contain multiple hash entries. A hash entry is a 3-tuple defining the type of
hash algorithm used, the hash value expected and the asset associated with the
hash. A tuple entry is defined on a single line with each entry separated by
whitespace characters. For example:

.. code-block:: text

   # my hashes
   sha1 f606cb022b86086407ad735bf4ec83478dc0a2c5 my-archive.tgz
   sha1 602effb4893c7504ffee8a8efcd265d86cd21609 LICENSE

Comments are permitted in the file. Lines leading with a ``#`` character or
inlined leading ``#`` character after a whitespace character will be ignored.

Officially supported hash types are FIPS-180 algorithms (``sha1``, ``sha224``,
``sha256``, ``sha384`` and ``sha512``) as well as (but not recommended) RSA'S
MD5 algorithm. Other algorithms, while unofficially supported, can be used if
provided by the system's OpenSSL library.

Multiple hash entries can be provided for the same file if desired. This is to
assist in scenarios where a checked out asset's content changes based on the
system it is checked out on. For example, a text file checked out from Git may
use Windows line-ending on Windows system, and Unix-line endings on other
systems:

.. code-block:: text

   sha1 602effb4893c7504ffee8a8efcd265d86cd21609 LICENSE
   sha1 9e79b84ef32e911f8056d80a311cf281b2121469 LICENSE
