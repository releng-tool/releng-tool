.. note::

   An alternative to using an ASCII-armor to validate a package's cache is to
   use :ref:`hashes <hash_files>` instead.

When downloading assets from a remote instance, an ASCII-armor file can be used
to help verify the integrity of any fetched content. For example, if a package
lists a site with a ``my-archive.tgz`` to download, the fetch process will
download the archive and verify its contents with an associated ASCII-armor file
(if one is provided). If the integrity of the file cannot be verified, the build
process stops indicating an unexpected asset was downloaded.

To include an ASCII-armor file for a package, add a ``<my-package>.asc`` file
inside the package's directory. Verification is performed using the host
system's ``gpg``. For verification's to succeed, the system must already have
the required public keys registered.
