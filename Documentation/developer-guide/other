post-processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   A post-processing script (if used) will be invoked each time ``releng-tool``
   reaches the final stage of a build.

After each package has been processed, a project has the ability to perform
post-processing. Post-processing allows a developer to cleanup the target
directory, build an archive/package from generated results and more. If a
project contains a ``releng-post`` inside the root directory, the
post-processing script will be invoked in the final stage of a build.

A developer may start out with the following post-processing script
``<root>/releng-post``:

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python
   # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

   print('post processing...')

The above script will output the newly inserted print message at the end of a
build process:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ releng-tool
   ...
   generating license information...
   post processing...
   (success) completed (0:01:30)

A developer can take advantage of `environment variables`_ and
`script helpers`_ for additional support.

It is important to note that a post-processing script will be invoked each time
a ``releng-tool`` invoke reaches the final stage of a build. A developer should
attempt to implement the post-processing script in a way that it can be invoked
multiple times. For example, if a developer decides to move a file out of the
target directory into an interim directory when building an archive, it is most
likely that a subsequent request to build may fail since the file can no longer
be found inside the target directory.

.. _license_information:

licenses
~~~~~~~~

A releng-tool project can defined multiple packages, each with the possibility
of having multiple licenses associated with them. Each project may vary: some
may have only proprietary sources and may not care about tracking this
information; some may only use open source software and require to populate
license information for a final package; or a mix.

When license information is populated for a project, each project's license
information (|LIBFOO_LICENSE_FILES|_) is will be populated into a single license
document. If a developer defines the |CONF_LICENSE_HEADER|_ configuration,
the generated document will be prefixed with the header content. For example,
``releng`` can be configured to prepare a license header from a local file
``assets/license-header.tpl``:

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python
   # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

   import os

   ... (other configuration options)

   root_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
   license_header_file = os.path.join(root_dir, 'assets', 'license-header.tpl')

   with open(license_header_file) as f:
       license_header = ''.join(f.readlines())

A side note is that licenses for a project are generated before the
`post-processing`_ phase; hence, generated license document(s) may be included
when attempting to generated final archives/packages.

patching
~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Patches are ignored when in :ref:`development mode` for packages with a
   development version revision or when in :ref:`local-sources mode` for
   internal packages.

The patching stage for a package provides the ability for a developer to apply
one or more patches to extracted sources. A project may define an external
package which fetches an archive that is not maintained by the project owners.
The fetched source may not be able to build in a developer's releng-tool project
due to limitations of the implementation or build scripts provided by the
package. A developer can prepare a series of patches to apply to a package and
submit changes upstream to correct the issue; however, the developer is then
left to either wait for the changes to be merged in or needs to make a custom
archive with the appropriate modifications already applied. To avoid this, a
developer can include patches directly in the package folder to be automatically
applied during patching stage.

When a package's patch stage is reached, releng-tool will look for patches found
inside the package folder with the extension ``.patch``. Patches found inside a
package folder are applied in ascending order. It is recommended to prefix
patch filenames with a numerical value for clarity. For example, the following
package patches:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ cd package/liba
   $ ls *.patch
   0001-accept-linker-flags.patch
   0002-correct-output-path.patch
   0003-support-disabling-test-build.patch
   liba
   lib.hash

With be applied in the following order:

1. ``0001-accept-linker-flags.patch``
2. ``0002-correct-output-path.patch``
3. ``0003-support-disabling-test-build.patch``

If a user configures their build environment in :ref:`development mode`, patches
will not be applied if a package defines a development revisions. The idea is
that a development revision is most likely the bleeding edge source of a
package and does not need any patches. If a user configures their build
environment in :ref:`local-sources mode` and a package is defined as internal,
patches will not be applied to the sources. This is to prevent the patching
system from making unexpected modifications to a developer's local source
variants.

internal and external packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Packages are either internal packages or external packages. All packages are
considered external packages by default unless explicitly configured as internal
through either the package option |LIBFOO_INTERNAL|_ or using the project
configuration |CONF_DEFAULT_INTERN|_ (see also |LIBFOO_EXTERNAL|_). Both package
types are almost treated the same except for the following:

- An internal package will not generate output warnings if the package is
  missing :ref:`hash information <hash_files>` or an
  :ref:`ASCII-armor <ascii_armor>`.
- An internal package will not generate output warnings if the package is
  missing :ref:`license information <license_information>`.
- When configured for :ref:`development mode`; the patch stage will not be
  performed if the package specifies a development revision
  (|LIBFOO_DEVMODE_REVISION|_).
- When configured for :ref:`local-sources mode`; the fetch, extract and patch
  stages will not be performed.

script helpers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

releng-tool provides a series of helper functions which can be used in
script-based packages, post-processing and more. Helper functions provided are
listed below:

.. _os.path.join: https://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html#os.path.join

Scripts directly invoked by releng-tool will automatically have these helpers
registered in the script's globals module (i.e. no import is necessary). If a
project defines custom Python modules in their project and wishes to take
advantage of these helper functions, the following import can be used to, for
example, import a specific function:

.. code-block:: python

    from releng_tool import releng_execute

Or, if desired, all helper methods can be imported at once:

.. code-block:: python

    from releng_tool import *

vcs ignore
~~~~~~~~~~

When invoking releng-tool on a project, the project's root directory will be
populated with cached assets and other output files. A series of standard ignore
patterns can be applied to a repository to prevent observing these generated
files using VCS tools. The following is an example ignore configuration which
can be applied for Git-based repositories (via ``.gitignore``):

.. code-block:: text

   # releng-tool
   /cache/
   /dl/
   /output/
   .releng-flag-*

.. _quirks:

quirks
~~~~~~

The following outlines a series of configuration |CONF_QUIRKS|_ that can be
applied to deal with rare host environment scenarios.

- ``releng.cmake.disable_parallel_option`` -- Disables the ``--parallel`` option
  from being injected when a CMake-package is performing a build stage. This is
  to help support host systems running variants of CMake which do not explicitly
  provide a parallelization option.
- ``releng.disable_prerequisites_check`` -- Disables the fast-fail prerequisites
  check from running.
- ``releng.disable_remote_configs`` -- Disables any attempt to load
  remote-defined configurations for a package.
- ``releng.disable_remote_scripts`` -- Disables any attempt to load
  remote-defined scripts for a package.
- ``releng.git.no_depth`` -- Disables the ``--depth`` option from being injected
  when a Git-site-defined package is performing a fetch stage.
- ``releng.git.no_quick_fetch`` -- Disables quick fetching (a specific reference
  fetch) for any Git-site-defined package.

Quirks are enabled through a configuration (override) script such as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   quirks = [
       '<quirk-value>',
   ]

loading extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   If looking for information on developing extensions for releng-tool, consult
   the :ref:`contributor's guide -- extensions <contributor_guide_ext>`.

A releng-tool project can define one or more extensions to load for externally
implemented capabilities. For example, a project can load extensions
``ext-a`` and ``ext-b`` with the following defined in their project's
configuration:

.. code-block:: python

   extensions = [
       'ext-a',
       'ext-b',
   ]

During the initial stages of a release engineering process, releng-tool will
check and load any configured extension. In the event that an extension is
missing, is unsupported for the running releng-tool version or fails to load, a
detailed error message will be presented to the user.

While the ability to load extensions is supported, capabilities provided by
extensions are not officially supported by releng-tool. For issues related to
specific extension use, it is recommended to consult the documentation provided
by the providers of said extensions.
