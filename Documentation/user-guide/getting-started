getting started
---------------

Depending on the host and how releng-tool has been :doc:`installed <install>`,
the tool can be either executed using the call ``releng-tool`` (if supported) or
explicitly through a Python invoke ``python -m releng_tool``. This guide will
assume the former option is available for use. If the alias command is not
available on the host system, the latter call can be used instead.

A releng-tool project will be defined by a ``releng`` configuration file along
with one or more packages found inside a ``package/`` folder. This location can
be referred to as the "root directory". When invoking ``releng-tool``, the tool
will look into the current working directory for the project information to
process. For example, if a project found inside ``my-project`` with the single
package ``package-a`` defined, the following output may be observed:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ cd my-project
   $ releng-tool
   extracting package-a...
   patching package-a...
   configuring package-a...
   building package-a...
   installing package-a...
   generating license information...
   (success) completed (0:01:30)

On a successful execution, it is common that the release engineering process
will have an asset (or multiple) generated into a ``images/`` location; however,
it is up to the developer of a releng-tool project to decide where generated
files will be stored.

If a user wishes to pass the directory of a project location via command line,
the argument ``--root-dir`` can be used:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ releng-tool --root-dir my-project/
   ...

For a complete list of actions and other argument options provided by the tool,
the ``--help`` option can be used to show this information:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ releng-tool --help
