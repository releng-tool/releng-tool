    the command ``run_path`` is invoked several times to help load settings and

    also assisting in allow some-level of sharing user-defined constants, the
    list of globals to be populated can be extended each execution and be passed
    into a following script. Not all global options are desired to be passed.
    For example, Python magic options and referenced built-in functions. This
    method can be used to easily extend an existing dictionary of globals while
    also filtering out undesired entries output from external scripts.

    helper to easily fetch or configure an environment variable

    .. versionadded:: 0.3

    Provides a caller a simple method to fetch or configure an environment
    variable for the current context. This call is the same as if one directly
    fetched from or managed a key-value with ``os.environ``. If ``value`` is not
    provided, the environment variable's value (if set) will be returned. If
    ``value`` is set to a value of ``None``, any set environment variable will
    be removed.

    An example when using in the context of script helpers is as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        # get an environment variable
        value = releng_env('KEY')

        # set an environment variable
        releng_env('KEY', 'VALUE')
