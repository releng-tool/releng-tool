# Below should contain a series of helper implementations to assist releng-tool
# developer's wanting to explicitly import script helpers into scripts not
# directly invoked by releng-tool. When releng-tool invokes a project's script
# (whether it be a configuration script, a package stage-specific script (e.g.
# a package's build script), etc.), a series of utility functions will be made
# available with a pre-populated globals module. If a project defines their own
# Python modules for script support, these modules will not have a graceful way
# to take advantage of these utility methods. To assist developers in this
# situation, utility functions will be included below to expose them into the
# `releng` namespace. A developer with a custom Python script can now import
# specific utility methods using, for example, the following:
#
#     from releng import releng_execute
#
# Note: changes introduced here should be synonymous with engine-shared helpers:
#        RelengEngine._prepareSharedEnvironment
